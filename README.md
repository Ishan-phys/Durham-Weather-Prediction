# Durham-Weather-Prediction

In this project, we use the Durham temperature record data from 1901-2019 to predict the average temperature in Durham, UK in the year 2020. The data consists
of daily readings of the maximum and the minimum temperature values. Using these values, the
daily average temperature is calculated. The provided
dataset is time-series data as the average temperature is measured over equal time intervals. To
forecast using time series data, we need to fit a machine learning model to the historical data and
use it to predict future observations. We chose to use a deep learning model known as LSTM to
predict the daily average temperature for the year 2020 using the given historical data.
